here is some text

My 3rd commit. Still trying to figure out what exactly I'm supposed to type in order to push this onto my repo

It seems I have to git commit -m ""
and then git push origin? or can I just git push origin
	this is 4th commit, trying without git commit -m""
	to see if I only need to git push origin

Wait no that's dumb you have to commit in order to push right?
	this is still 4th commit,

Break down:

	first commit successful > I don't know how I did it
	second commit commited but no change to the txt therefore update > same
	3rd commit successful > figured out what to type. Trying to figure out what 		triggers the push

	4th commit (attempt) > I realize you have to git commit -m "" in order to git push 	origin but wondering if I have to git more stuff even before that.
	
Actual 4th commit, git commit -m "" then git push origin
